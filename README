NAME
    Apache::No404Proxy - 404 Redirecting Proxy

SYNOPSIS
      # in httpd.conf
      PerlTransHandler Apache::No404Proxy # default uses ::Google

DESCRIPTION
    Oops, 404 Not found. But wait..., there is a Google cache!

    Apache::No404Proxy serves as a proxy server, which automaticaly detects
    404 responses and redirects your browser to Google cache.

    Set your browser's proxy setting to Apache::No404Proxy based server, and
    it becomes 404 free now!

    See also the section on "RESRICTIONS FOR USE" before you use this.

SUBCLASSING
    Default cache archive is Google's one. Here is how you customize this.

    *   Declare your URL translator class.

    *   Inherit from Apache::No404Proxy.

    *   Define "translate()" method.

    That's all. Here is an example of implementation, extracted from
    Apache::No404Proxy::Google.

      package Apache::No404Proxy::Google;

      use WWW::Cache::Google;
      use base qw(Apache::No404Proxy);

      sub translate {
          my($class, $uri) = @_;
          return WWW::Cache::Google->new($uri)->as_string;
      }

    Define "translate()" method as a class method. Argument $uri is a string
    that represents URI.

    At last, remember to add the following line to httpd.conf:

      PerlTransHandler Apache::No404Proxy::Google

RESTRICTIONS FOR USE
    READ THIS before you use this proxy, especially for the default Google
    implementation.

    This proxy may or may not break terms of service of Google. In fact,
    Google prohibits *Automatic Query* without their permissions. See
    http://www.google.com/terms_of_service.html for details.

    Yes, this means you are recommended to contact staff at Google,
    otherwise your IP address would be blacklisted from Google :( The one
    you should get contact with is Ray Sidney, whose email addy is
    <ray@google.com>. Thanks to Ray for his kindness.
